The package mms2plot visualizes multiple tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) for modificated and/or unmodified peptides identified from the same raw MS files, annotated by peptide identification algorithms. It will output a mirror-style plot for two peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and a multiple-parallal plot for more than two PSMs. Based on these plots, users can check and compare these matches. The output is set in PDF format and the output file width is recommended as 3.35 inch (single column) or 7 inch (double column). 

The input files for mms2plot are referred to as 1. two Maxquant parameter files (i.e. mqpar.xml and modifications.xml); 2. one maxquant output file (msms.txt). The input/output files of other search engines than Maxquant are easily converted to the maxquant styles. Additionally, the file path of MS raw files with mzML format should be provided.
