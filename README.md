The package mms2plot visualizes multiple tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) for modificated and/or unmodified peptides identified from the same raw MS files, annotated by peptide identification algorithms. It will output a mirror-style plot for two peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and a multiple-parallal plot for more than two PSMs. Based on these plots, users can check and compare these matches. The output is set in PDF format and the output file width is recommended as 3.35 inch (single column) or 7 inch (double column). 

The input files for mms2plot are referred to as the Maxquant modificaition file (e.g. modifications.xml or modification.local.xml), the parameter file used for Maxquant search (e.g. mqpar.xml) and one maxquant output file (i.e. msms.txt) in which the filepaths of MS raw files in .mzML format are assigned. These files from other search engines than Maxquant are easily converted to the maxquant styles. 

NOte: If you fail to install mms2plot on MS windows, please re-install it with admin rights.
